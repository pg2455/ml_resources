    "In this notebook, our focus is on harnessing Language Learning Models (LLMs) to empower agents with decision-making capabilities regarding their daily plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "Our objectives are threefold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enable agents to plan their daily activities.** This involves not just deciding on the activities themselves but also scheduling when and where these activities will take place.\n",
    "2. **Determine the actions and locations necessary for these activities** within their daily schedule, ensuring a structured approach to their day.\n",
    "3. **Navigate the agents through the maze** to accomplish these tasks, adding a layer of spatial dynamics to their planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging LLMs and the agents' memory structures, we plan to define and utilize planning functions to achieve these goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will explore how to facilitate interactions among agents, further enriching the simulation environment."

    "## Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires a bit more setup than usual. A key part of this setup involves defining our function for prompting LLMs. For the purposes of this tutorial, we've utilized GPT-3.5 via Azure OpenAI Studio, and thus our prompt functions are tailored to this environment. Should you opt to use different APIs, adjustments to these prompt functions will be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While most of the prompts have been directly adopted from the original Simulacra code, I've modified a few to enhance their reliability and reduce the likelihood of failure."

    "## Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, agent-based models (or simulations) relied on hardcoded behaviors to dictate how agents behave in their daily lives, encompassing activities like going to school or work. Hardcoding such behaviors requires extensive effort due to the myriad of possible scenarios, often resulting in a loss of heterogeneity among agents due to their similar patterns of behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of Language Learning Models (LLMs) has revolutionized this aspect, making it feasible to bypass the arduous task of hardcoding. By providing a description of an agent's character, LLMs can be prompted to outline suitable daily activities. The Original Simulacra code adopts this innovative approach by defining a broad daily agenda (`generate_day_plan`), such as accomplishing specific goals (e.g., writing a research paper). This agenda is then broken down into an hourly schedule (`generate_hourly_schedule`), detailing actions for each hour to achieve the day’s goals (e.g., visiting the library to write). Further, as the simulation clock reaches specific times, these hourly plans are decomposed into smaller, more detailed tasks (`generate_task_decompose`), like writing at the desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of Simulacra's design is that the hourly breakdown occurs only at the designated simulation time, allowing the day’s unfolding events to potentially modify future schedules. This flexibility is achieved through the `determine_action` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, LLMs primarily offer textual descriptions of activities. Translating these descriptions into specific locations within the simulation environment requires additional prompting. This translation is accomplished through functions like generate_action_sector, generate_action_sector_arena, generate_action_sector_arena_object, and generate_action_event_triple, incorporating both environmental and agent-specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "As events unfold and interactions occur throughout the day, agents may need to adjust their priorities for the following day. This involves updating their current goals, a process handled by the `generate_new_currently` function, which leverages `extract_relevant_nodes` to identify significant events from the past."
