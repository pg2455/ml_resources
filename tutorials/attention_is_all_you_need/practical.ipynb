    "# Tutorial: Attention is all you need\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will implement [Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)'s transductive model that is entirely based on attention mechanism instead of previously used recurrence models like RNNs. \n",
    "For example, in the case of English to German translation, an RNN would need to be trained sequentially such that the hidden state at time `t-1` along with the input at time `t` need to be known to compute the German translation upto that point. \n",
    "This not only introduces difficulty in training variable sized sequences but also draws upon an assumption that the translation changes from one part of the sequence to the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer architecture proposed by [Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) overcomes these problems by making the model entirely based on self-attention mechanism, thereby allowing for faster training due to efficient batching as well as doing away with the assumption on sequential nature of translation task. \n",
    "We will build such a transformer from scratch and train it on [Multimodal Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/multimodal-task.html#task1) task in this tutorial. \n",
    "This task is of appropriate size for us to get a full sense of how Transformer works. \n",
    "It has 29,000 English to German translations text for training, 1,014 for validation and 1,000 samples for test dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final evaluation will be done using METEOR metric which computes weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall (recall is given a weight of 90%) of the candidate translation with respect to the reference translation. \n",
    "Read more about this metric [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METEOR).\n",

    "When query, keys, and values are computed from the same input, it is termed as self-attention.\n",
    "Masking lets us nullify the weights of certain queries on certain keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three MHA units in Transformer and the corresponding masks required by them are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(A) Source padding mask**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MHA unit in the Encoder uses self-attention on source sentence, therefore, `query_length` and `key_length` are the same as number of positions in the source sentence. \n",
    "For this MHA unit, $A_{qk}$ denotes the weight of the $q^{th}$-token in the sentence on the $k^{th}$-token in the same sentence. \n",
    "Naturally, we don't want any $q^{th}$-token to attend to irrelevant padding-tokens, i.e., $\\forall k \\text{  s.t.  } src[k] == PAD\\text{_}IDX$.\n",
    "Thus, such a mask should contain 0 wherever either of the query or key token is a padding token.\n",

    "\n",
    "The MHA unit that connects encoder to decoders act upon target sentence's embeddings as queries and encoded embeddings as keys and values. \n",
    "The idea is to let the (partially) translated embedding (query) attend to the embeddings of all the tokens (keys and values) in the source sentence.\n",
    "Therefore, $A_{qk}$ denotes the weight of $q^{th}$-query in the translated sentence on the $k^{th}$-key in the source sentence. \n",

We are interested in modeling the likelihood of an output sequence $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{t}$ conditioned on an input $x$, i.e, $P(y_1, y_2, ..., y_t | x)$. This is in contrast to language models (LM) where we are interested in modeling the unconditional probability $p(y_1, y_2, ..., y_t) = \\Pi_{t=1}^{n}p(y_t | y_{<t})$ of a sequence $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{t}$. CLMs are modeled similarly as $P(y_1, y_2, ..., y_t | x) = \\Pi_{t=1}^{n}p(y_t | y_{<t}, x)$. Therefore, we need to predict one token at a time, $y_t$, conditioned on the past outputs $\\{y_{<t}\\}$ and the source $x$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a trained model, we need to use it to perform translation. \n",
    "For this, we will need to go back to the definition of CLMs, which models the likelihood of observing a sequence of words, i.e. $P(y_1, y_2, ..., y_t \\ |\\ x) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{t} p(y_{i} \\ | \\ y_{<i}, x)$.\n",
    "Thus, the inference procedure aims at finding the sequence $\\{\\hat{y}_i\\}_{i=1}^t$ with the maximum likelihood conditioned on $x$, i.e., $\\hat{y} =\\underset{y_1, y_2, ..., y_t}{\\operatorname{arg max}}P(y_1, y_2, ..., y_t \\ |\\ x) = \\underset{y_1, y_2, ..., y_t}{\\operatorname{arg max}}\\ \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{t} p(y_{i} \\ | \\ y_{<i}, x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we formulated the problem as sequence prediction, i.e., our model yields $p(y_{i} \\ | \\ y_{<i}, x)$, we will make this inference sequentially.\n",
    "Hence, finding the best sequence $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{t}$ is NP-Hard as one will have to check all the possibilities before finding the sequence with the maximum likelihood.\n",
    "Note that for a sequence of length $L$ if there are $N$ possible values, there will be a total of $N^{L}$ possibile sequences.\n",
    "For example, if there are $N=10^5$ unique tokens and a sequence is of length $L=5$, there will be $10^{25}$ possible sequences. \n",
    "As a result we will have to fall back on approximation algorithms to find a maximum likelihood sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can view the above search problem as drawing inference on a tree of depth $L$ with the root node as `<BOS>` token. \n",
    "Each node will have $N$ children, i.e., $N$ possible next token. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/tree.png\" width=1000>\n",

    "Finding the most likely sequence then boils down to moving from a node to another.\n",
    "Some of the ways to go about it are:\n",
    "- **Greedy Decoding**: Move to the most likely node given the current node in the tree. This results in the sequence $\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{t}\\underset{y_i}{\\operatorname{arg max}}p(y_i \\ | \\ y_{<i}, x)$. Note it is **not equivalent to finidng the maximum likleihood sequence** because $\\underset{y_1, y_2, ..., y_t}{\\operatorname{arg max}}\\ \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{t} p(y_{i} \\ | \\ y_{<i}, x) \\neq \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{t}\\underset{y_i}{\\operatorname{arg max}}p(y_i \\ | \\ y_{<i}, x)$\n",
